# Labyrinth - Brief Godot Platforming Experiment
## Game Development
### By: Brady DeBoer and Nathan Hart

Labyrinth was an effort learn how to use to Godot game engine and to practice developing an arcade-style platforming experience. Although it was not completed (we focused our efforts instead on the [Warehouse](https://github.com/NathanBHart/Warehouse) game for the ), here is our progress that we made.

> **Note:** For a better demonstration of our abilities using Godot, see the [Warehouse](https://github.com/NathanBHart/Warehouse) game we made for the [Godot Wild Game Jam](https://godotwildjam.com/) #35.

Some of what we implemented:
- Two players that can be controlled individually
- Basic combat system with health
- Basic collectable system
- Polymorphic enemy system
- Essential platforming framework
- Tilemap and world construction elements
- Filler pixel art for some game elements
- Basic UI elements

To run our code, download the file and open the "project.godot" file using the [Open Source Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/)
